I am a final year Mechanical Engineering student with a keen focus on simulation-driven iterative design. I have proven
hands-on experience in aerodynamics, CFD, FEA, and carbon-fiber composite manufacturing for high-performance engineering
applications. I have led the design, validation, and manufacturing process for the FSAE aerodynamic package, and contributed
to the drag-reduction optimization process in sustainable electric aviation.

## EXPERIENCE

### SYDNEY MOTORSPORT FORMULA STUDENT TEAM  

**Advisor**  
*February 2025 - Present*  
Working with the aerodynamics team to validate the full car aerodynamic package using the University of Sydney’s windtunnel as part of graduate thesis project. Provided technical guidance on CFD validation and composite manufacturing, utilsing in-house knowledge and development over the 4 years with the team.

**Aerodynamics Section Lead**  
*December 2023 - February 2025*  
    Led a team of 10 student engineers for the in-house development and manufacturing of a full aerodynamics package using
  SOLIDWORKS, ANSYS Fluent, laser cutting, and 3D printing. We delivered a structurally robust aerodynamic package
  with improved structural rigidity over previous years while maintaining a strict 3 kg weight target. This required the design
  of a rib and spar system for the front wing to handle both expected and unexpected loads during testing and competition.
  Coordinated the large full car assemblies (>1000 parts) to ensure team design cohesion, enforced compliance with FSAE
  rules, and managed my personal and teams timelines and task delegation to ensure the car was delivered on time.

**Aerodynamics Engineer**  
*July 2022 - December 2023*  
Designed and validated the front wing and under-tray of the SM23 vehicle using CFD within ANSYS Fluent. Conducted an
  iterative design processes using a large computing cluster to optimize aerodynamic performance. Participated in mold de-
  sign and manufacturing, and performed carbon fiber layups using pre-impregnated and conventional wet-layup techniques
  to produce high-performance composite component.

### DOVETAIL ELECTRIC AVIATION  

**Computational Fluid Dynamics Engineer (Intern)**  
*September 2023 - January 2024*  
Reverse-engineered a propeller nacelle assembly by generating parametric CAD models from 3D scans in SOLIDWORKS.
  Validated scanned propeller geometry in ANSYS Fluent, allowing for the optimization of cooling duct geometries to be
  developed, minimizing drag and improve airflow duct efficiency. Created efficient lightweight CFD models to reduce
  simulation time and resource consumption, without impact to data resolution.

## TECHNICAL PROJECTS

- Homelab Server - Functions as both a local media server and a self-hosted cloud storage solution, enabling high-speed remote access and data redundancy.
- Robotic Arm - A 6-axis robotic arm powered by NEMA stepper motors, with motion transmitted via belt drives to reduce backlash. The accuracy was enhanced through a custom-developed zero-backlash cycloidal gearbox tailored for precise torque and speed control.
- Custom PC Peripherals - Engineered a 32-gram fingertip grip mouse optimized for competitive FPS gaming, and assembled a Lily58 split ortholinear keyboard with a custom-designed case for improved ergonomics and portability.
- UNIX - Daily-operated dual-boot Windows/Linux setups, leveraging distros such as Arch and Ubuntu derivatives for development flexibility, customization, and deep system-level understanding.
